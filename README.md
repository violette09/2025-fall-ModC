# 2025-fall-ModC
This repository contains materials for Milestone One of the OMDS (Online Master of Data Science) Module C Integrated Capstone Project.

## Overview

This project contains weekly Jupyter notebooks that apply data science concepts to a capstone project dataset. Each week covers specific topics that build upon previous weeks.
