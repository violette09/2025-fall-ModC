# Weekly Jupyter Notebooks - Integrated Capstone Project

This directory contains weekly Jupyter notebooks for the Integrated Capstone Project (Milestone One - OMDS Mod C).

## Structure

Each week has its own directory containing Jupyter notebooks covering specific data science concepts applied to your capstone project dataset.

## Week 1: Linear Regression

**Location:** `week01/week01_linear_regression.ipynb`

**Topics Covered:**
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Terms
- Interaction Terms
- Multicollinearity Detection
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- Working with Categorical and Continuous Features
- Model Diagnostics and Residual Analysis
- Feature Importance

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipy

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you'll need to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels scipy jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   # or
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/2025-fall-ModC
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Open the desired week's notebook from the `notebooks/` directory

5. Replace the sample data with your actual capstone project dataset

6. Run the cells and complete the exercises

## Getting Started

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Ensure your capstone project dataset is accessible
2. **Load Your Data**: Replace the sample data in each notebook with your actual dataset
3. **Follow Along**: Execute cells sequentially and read the explanations
4. **Complete Exercises**: Each notebook includes exercises to apply concepts to your data
5. **Document Findings**: Add markdown cells to document your observations and insights

## Tips for Success

- **Read Carefully**: Each section includes explanations and interpretations
- **Experiment**: Try different parameters and approaches
- **Visualize**: Use the provided visualization techniques to understand your data
- **Document**: Keep notes on what works and what doesn't
- **Ask Questions**: If something isn't clear, seek clarification before moving on

## Weekly Topics (Planned)

- **Week 1**: Linear Regression (âœ“ Complete)
- **Weeks 2-14**: Additional topics to be added

## Notes

- All notebooks include sample data for demonstration purposes
- You should replace sample data with your actual capstone project dataset
- Each notebook builds on previous weeks, so complete them in order
- Save your work frequently and version control your changes

## Support

For questions or issues with these notebooks:
1. Review the documentation in each notebook
2. Check the course materials
3. Consult with your instructor or teaching assistant
